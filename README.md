Version control refers to the process of handling and organizing numerous versions and copies of document files, software, and many other projects. In fact, version control is used in numerous cases to manage these collections of data. The primary reason why version control is so critical, especially in software development, is to ensure that important software, code, or documents arenâ€™t lost. This is particularly important in the case where a large team is working on a single project, where multiple copies of that project exist. It is important to keep track of each copy and to make sure that there is a centralize copy that gets updated. This centralized copy, also often referred to as the root or master branch, is where updates are permanently made.
